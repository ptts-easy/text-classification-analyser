theorists belonging to diverse fields.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[3][4][5] Many agree that education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, especially the transmission of knowledge.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[6] But they often include other aims as well, such as fostering skills and character traits.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[6][3][7] However, there are deep disagreements about the exact nature of education besides these general characteristics.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"According to some conceptions, it is primarily a process that occurs during events like schooling, teaching, and learning.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[8][9][4] Others understand it not as a process but as the achievement or product brought about by this process.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"On this view, education is what educated persons have, i.e. the mental states and dispositions that are characteristic of them.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[8][9][4] However, the term may also refer to the academic study of the methods and processes taking place during teaching and learning, as well as the social institutions involved in these processes.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[11][12][3] This and similar attempts are often successful at characterizing the most paradigmatic forms of education but have received numerous criticisms nonetheless, usually in the form of specific counterexamples for which the proposed criteria fail.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[12][13][4] These difficulties have led various theorists to develop less precise conceptions based on family resemblance.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"This means that all the different forms of education are similar to each other even though they need not share an essential set of features characteristic of all of them.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[3][14][15] This view can also be combined with the idea that the meaning of the term \"education\" is context-dependent and may thus vary depending on the situation in which it is used.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[4] Having a clear idea of what the term means is important for various issues: it is needed to identify and coherently talk about it as well as to determine how to achieve and measure it.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[16][17][18]\r\n\r\nThere is disagreement in the academic literature on whether education is an evaluative concept.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"So-called thick definitions affirm this, for example, by holding that an improvement of the learner is a necessary requirement of education.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"However, different thick definitions may still disagree among themselves on what constitutes such an improvement.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Thin definitions, on the other hand, try to give a value-neutral account of education.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[17][19] A closely related distinction is that between descriptive and prescriptive conceptions.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Descriptive conceptions aim to describe how the term is actually used by regular speakers while prescriptive conceptions try to express what good education is or how it should be done.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[6][20]\r\n\r\nMany thick and prescriptive conceptions base their account on the aims of education, i.e. regarding the goals that the activity of education tries to achieve.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[21][22][23] These aims are sometimes categorized into epistemic goods, like knowledge and understanding, skills, like rationality and critical thinking, and character traits, like kindness and honesty.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[17] Some theorists focus on one overarching purpose of education and see the more specific aims as means to this end.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[24][22] This can take the form of socialization, in which accumulated knowledge is transmitted from one generation to the next with the goal of helping the student function as a regular citizen in society.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[6][25][4] More person-centered definitions focus on the well-being of the student instead: education is to help them lead a good life or the life they wish to lead.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[6][24][4] Various researchers emphasize critical thinking as an aim in order to distinguish education from indoctrination.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[22][23][26] This is motivated by the idea that mere indoctrination is only interested in instilling beliefs in the student without concern for their evidential status.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[22][21] Education, on the other hand, should also foster the rational ability to critically reflect on those beliefs and question them.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[27] However, some theorists contend that certain forms of indoctrination may be necessary in the early stages of education until the child's mind is sufficiently developed.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[22]\r\n\r\nEducation can be characterized from the teacher's or the student's perspective.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Teacher-centered definitions focus on the perspective and role of the teacher, for example, in the form of transmitting knowledge and skills while doing so in a morally appropriate manner.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[28][4][11] Student-centered definitions, on the other hand, outline education based on the student's experience in the learning process, for example, based on how education transforms and enriches their subsequent experience.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[29][12][30] However, conceptualizations taking both perspectives into account are also possible.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"This can take the form of describing the process as the shared experience of a common world that involves discovery as well as posing and solving problems.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[12][28][31]\r\n\r\nTypes\r\nThere are various ways how forms of education are commonly subdivided into different types.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"The most common subdivision is between formal, non-formal, and informal education.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[32][33][4][34] However, some theorists only distinguish between formal and informal education.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[35] A process of teaching constitutes formal education if it happens in a complex institutionalized framework.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Such frameworks are usually chronologically and hierarchically organized as in modern schooling systems, which have different classes based on the student's age and progress, all the way from primary school to university.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Because of its scale, formal education is usually controlled and guided by a governmental entity and is normally compulsory up to a certain age.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[32][36] Non-formal and informal education differ from formal education due to their lack of such a governmental institutionalized framework.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Non-formal education constitutes a middle ground in the sense that it is also organized, systematic, and carried out with a clear purpose in mind, such as tutoring, fitness classes, or the scouting movement.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[32][36][4] Informal education, on the other hand, happens in an unsystematic way through daily experiences and exposure to the environment.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Unlike formal and non-formal education, there is usually no designated authority figure responsible for teaching.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[33] Informal education is present in many different settings and happens throughout one's life, mostly in a spontaneous manner.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"This is how children usually learn their mother tongue from their parents or when learning how to prepare a certain dish by cooking together.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[32][36][4] Some accounts tie the difference between the three types mainly to the location where the learning takes place: in school for formal education, in places of the individual's day-to-day routine for informal education, and in other places occasionally visited for non-formal education.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[33] It has been argued that the motivation responsible for formal education is predominantly extrinsic, whereas it tends to be mainly intrinsic for non-formal and informal education.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[33] The distinction between the three types is normally clear for the paradigmatic cases but there are various intermediate forms of education that do not easily fall into one category.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[32][33]\r\n\r\nFormal education plays a central role in modern civilization.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"But in primitive cultures, most of the education happens not on the formal but on the informal level.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[25][37][38] This usually means that there is no distinction between activities focused on education and other activities.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Instead, the whole environment may be seen as a form of school and many or all adults may act as teachers.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"An important reason for moving to formal forms of education is due to the sheer quantity of knowledge to be passed on, which requires both a formal setting and well-trained teachers to be transmitted effectively.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"A side effect of the process of formalization is that the educational experience becomes more abstract and more removed from daily life.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"In this regard, more emphasis is put on grasping general patterns instead of observing and imitating particular behavior.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[25][37]\r\n\r\nClosely related to the distinction between formal and informal education is that between conscious education, which is done with a clear purpose in mind, and unconscious education, which occurs on its own without being consciously planned or guided.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[39] This may happen in part through the personality of teachers and adults by having indirect effects on the development of the student's personality.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[40] Another categorization depends on the age group of the learners and includes childhood education, adolescent education, adult education, and elderly education.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[41][42][43] The distinction can also be based on the subject, encompassing fields like science education, language education, art education, religious education, and physical education.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[45] The term \"alternative education\" is sometimes used for a wide range of educational methods and approaches outside mainstream pedagogy, for example, like the emphasis on narration and storytelling found in indigenous education or autodidacticism.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[46][47][48] Forms of education can also be categorized by the medium used, for example, as distance education, like online education, e-learning, or m-learning, in contrast to regular classroom or onsite education.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[49][4][25] Various types of online education take the form of open education, where the courses and materials are made available with a minimal amount of barriers.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[50] Another classification is based on the social institution responsible for education and may include categories for institutions like family, school, civil society, state, and church.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[51][52] When the term education is used in the sense of an achievement or a product, expressions like type or level of education refer to the person's academic or professional qualification, such as high school completion, bachelor's degree, master's degree, doctor's degree, or degrees in vocational training.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"For the subfield of formal epistemology and computer science, see Formal learning

express what good education is or how it should be done.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[6][20]\r\n\r\nMany thick and prescriptive conceptions base their account on the aims of education, i.e. regarding the goals that the activity of education tries to achieve.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[21][22][23] These aims are sometimes categorized into epistemic goods, like knowledge and understanding, skills, like rationality and critical thinking, and character traits, like kindness and honesty.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[17] Some theorists focus on one overarching purpose of education and see the more specific aims as means to this end.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[24][22] This can take the form of socialization, in which accumulated knowledge is transmitted from one generation to the next with the goal of helping the student function as a regular citizen in society.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[6][25][4] More person-centered definitions focus on the well-being of the student instead: education is to help them lead a good life or the life they wish to lead.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[6][24][4] Various researchers emphasize critical thinking as an aim in order to distinguish education from indoctrination.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[22][23][26] This is motivated by the idea that mere indoctrination is only interested in instilling beliefs in the student without concern for their evidential status.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[22][21] Education, on the other hand, should also foster the rational ability to critically reflect on those beliefs and question them.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[27] However, some theorists contend that certain forms of indoctrination may be necessary in the early stages of education until the child's mind is sufficiently developed.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[22]\r\n\r\nEducation can be characterized from the teacher's or the student's perspective.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Teacher-centered definitions focus on the perspective and role of the teacher, for example, in the form of transmitting knowledge and skills while doing so in a morally appropriate manner.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[28][4][11] Student-centered definitions, on the other hand, outline education based on the student's experience in the learning process, for example, based on how education transforms and enriches their subsequent

types.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"The most common subdivision is between formal, non-formal, and informal education.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[32][33][4][34] However, some theorists only distinguish between formal and informal education.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[35] A process of teaching constitutes formal education if it happens in a complex institutionalized framework.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Such frameworks are usually chronologically and hierarchically organized as in modern schooling systems, which have different classes based on the student's age and progress, all the way from primary school to university.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Because of its scale, formal education is usually controlled and guided by a governmental entity and is normally compulsory up to a certain age.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[32][36] Non-formal and informal education differ from formal education due to their lack of such a governmental institutionalized framework.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Non-formal education constitutes a middle ground in the sense that it is also organized, systematic, and carried out with a clear purpose in mind, such as tutoring, fitness classes, or the scouting movement.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[32][36][4] Informal education, on the other hand, happens in an unsystematic way through daily experiences and exposure to the environment.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Unlike formal and non-formal education, there is usually no designated authority figure responsible for teaching.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[33] Informal education is present in many different settings and happens throughout one's life, mostly in a spontaneous manner.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"This is how children usually learn their mother tongue from their parents or when learning how to prepare a certain dish by cooking together.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[32][36][4] Some accounts tie the difference between the three types mainly to the location where the learning takes place: in school for formal education, in places of the individual's day-to-day routine for informal education, and in other places occasionally visited for non-formal education.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[33] It has been argued that the motivation responsible for formal education is predominantly extrinsic, whereas it tends to be mainly intrinsic for non-formal and informal education.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[33] The distinction between the three types is normally clear for the paradigmatic cases but there are various intermediate forms of education that do not easily fall into one category.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[32][33]\r\n\r\nFormal education plays a central role in modern civilization.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"But in primitive cultures, most of the education happens not on the formal but on the informal level.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[25][37][38] This usually means that there is no distinction between activities focused on education and other activities.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Instead, the whole environment may be seen as a form of school and many or all adults may act as teachers.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"An important reason for moving to formal forms of education is due to the sheer quantity of knowledge to be passed on, which requires both a formal setting and well-trained teachers to be transmitted effectively.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"A side effect of the process of formalization is that the educational experience becomes more abstract and more removed from daily life.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"In this regard, more emphasis is put on grasping general patterns instead of observing and imitating particular behavior.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[25][37]\r\n\r\nClosely related to the distinction between formal and informal education is that between conscious education, which is done with a clear purpose in mind, and unconscious education, which occurs on its own without being consciously planned or guided.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[39] This may happen in part through the personality of teachers and adults by having indirect effects on the development of the student's personality.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[40] Another categorization depends on the age group of the learners and includes childhood education, adolescent education, adult education, and elderly education.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[41][42][43] The distinction can also be based on the subject, encompassing fields like science education, language education, art education, religious education, and physical education.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[45] The term \"alternative education\" is sometimes used for a wide range of educational methods and approaches outside mainstream pedagogy, for example, like the emphasis on narration and storytelling found in indigenous education or autodidacticism.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[46][47][48] Forms of education can also be categorized by the medium used, for example, as distance education, like online education, e-learning, or m-learning, in contrast to regular classroom or onsite education.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[49][4][25] Various types of online education take the form of open education, where the courses and materials are made available with a minimal amount of barriers.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[50] Another classification is based on the social institution responsible for education and may include categories for institutions like family, school, civil society, state, and church.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[51][52] When the term education is used in the sense of an achievement or a product, expressions like type or level of education refer to the person's academic or professional qualification, such as high school completion, bachelor's degree, master's degree, doctor's degree, or degrees in vocational training.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"For the subfield of formal epistemology and computer science, see Formal learning theory.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit purpose is teaching students.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject.","intent":"education"},{"domain":"default","utterance":"[54][55] It can be subdivided into various categories or
